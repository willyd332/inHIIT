### Description:

inHIIT is an application made with a React.js frontend and a JAVA/SpringBoot backend. The front end and back end were made independently as inHIIT was origionally created to be used with an Express.js backend. 

The app itself is a CRUD application that allows users to create High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) timers that consist of different intervals and an amout of cycles. It was created to give users the ability to do HIIT excercises without hiving to be constantly reseting their timer. For example: a workout [ 30 second sprint ==> 10 second rest) then repeat 5 times ] could be easily created with inHIIT an consolidated into a singular timer.
